# Learn Frontend Workshop

In this workshop we are going to teach you common components frontend developers typically build out for a website. You can use this readme as a reference material for HTML and CSS.

## HTML DOCS

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a language which allows us to write pages for the world wide web. It is a markup language, it enables us to write webpages using code to indicate how text and data should be displayed. HTML files also end with the extension .html like index.html or foo.html.

### HTML TEMPLATE

This is what the structure of an HTML Document

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    ....content of webpage.....
</body>
</html>
```
