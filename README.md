# Learn Frontend Workshop

In this workshop we are going to teach you common components frontend developers typically build out for a website. You can use this readme as a reference material for HTML and CSS.

## HTML DOCS

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a language which allows us to write pages for the world wide web. It is a markup language, it enables us to write webpages using code to indicate how text and data should be displayed. HTML files also end with the extension .html like index.html or foo.html.

### HTML TEMPLATE

This is what the structure of an HTML Document look like

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    ....content of webpage.....
</body>
</html>
```

### Common HTML elements/tags

* **<!DOCTYPE>** 	Defines the document type
* **\<html>** - Defines an HTML document
* **\<head>** - Defines information about the document
* **\<title>** - Defines a title for the document
* **\<body>** - Defines the document's body
* **\<h1> to \<h6>** - Defines HTML headings
* **\<p>** - Defines a paragraph
* **\<br>** - Inserts a single line break
* **\<!--...-->** - Defines a comment
* **\<ul>** - Defines a container for an unordered list
* **\<ol>** - Defines a container for an ordered list
* **\<li>** - Defines a single list items
* **\<a href="">** - Defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. Href indicates the link's destination.
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
* **\<img src="" alt="">** - Defines an image from the src value and gives alternative based on alt value
* **\<div>** - Defines a container for elements
* **\<section>** - Defines a container for elements

###IDS vs CLASSES
Ids are used to uniquely identify one element on the page while classes can be used to identify more than one element.
ID example

```
<div id="example">Some text</div>
```

Class example

```
<div class="example">Some text</div>
```
